===========

This part of the current code, that uses an arduino for some of the engine and hydraulic controls.
Added graphie, which visualises via python, some outputs from the current code.
Hopefully soon there will be some new additions, maybe.

Added a revision of the previous code, with adaptions for the new arduino Due. :)

PMT
